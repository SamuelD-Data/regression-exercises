    "### What\n",
    "- Since models are approximations of reality, we're measuring how closely our linear models approximate reality.\n",
    "- With evaluating regression models, we'll calculate this closeness by measuring the error, which is the distance between the regression line (prediction) and actual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques in this lesson answer the following questions:\n",
    "- How do we know if our model is good enough?\n",
    "- How do we evaluate our model?\n",
    "- Is our model valuable?\n",
    "- Are our features valuable?\n",
    "\n",
    "### How - what is our approach?\n",
    "Prerequisites\n",
    "- Establish a baseline (often the average of the target)\n",
    "- Build a super simple model (or isolate the model we're evaluating)\n",
    "- Calculate baseline and model residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the model\n",
    "- Calculate SSE, MSE, and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)\n",
    "- Determine if the model is significant\n",
    "- Determine if the features are significant\n",
    "\n",
    "### When do we evaluate a model?\n",
    "- As soon as we've got a super basic model, it's important to know if it beats baseline.\n",
    "- If so, we'll keep on modeling, making new models, tuning, etc...\n",
    "- If not, maybe a different model or different feature(s) will help."
